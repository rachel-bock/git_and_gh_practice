# Rachel's Travel Experience

I don't travel often.  Occassionally, my family goes to a hotel in the local Denver area or Colorado Springs and enjoys the pool.  

When I was a child, my family traveled to places like Disney World and Disneyland.  We also went to Key West, Florida.

As an adult, I've traveled to Orlando for a seminar.  

My sons would like to fly on a plane.

I would like to plan a vacation for the week around my birthday this year (2022).  I am hopeful that we'll all have the time off to take a vacation.
